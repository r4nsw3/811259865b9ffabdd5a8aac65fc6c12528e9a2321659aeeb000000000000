  |   Rebel Cops is a spin-off game from This Is the Police, which          |
  |   exclusively features the series' turned-based tactical operations.    |
  |   Lead a rag-tag squad of cops in rebellion against their town's new    |
  |   criminal power, and see how long you can hold out when you're         |
  |   constantly short on supplies, and a single shot can cost a cop his    |
  |   life.                                                                 |

  |   * Gunfights are thrilling, but stealth is key                         |
  |                                                                         |
